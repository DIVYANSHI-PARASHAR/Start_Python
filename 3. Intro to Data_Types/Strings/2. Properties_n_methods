STRING PROPERTIES AND METHODS

	IMMUTABILITY: It means we can't change any part of data once declared.
	
	eg:- >>>name = 'Sam'
	     >>>name[0] = 'P'
		 ----------Tracebackerror-------------
		 
		 >>>name[1:] = 'am'
		 >>>last_letters = name[1:]
		 >>>last_letters
		 'am'
		 >>>'P' + last_letters           # STRING CONCATENATION
		 'Pam'
		 
STRING CONCATENATION: It allows us to quickly put strings together.
		
		>>>x = 'Hello World '
		>>>x + "it is beautiful outside!!!"
		'Hello World it is beautiful outside!!!'
		
		
There is also STRING MULTIPLICATION you can do-----to do multiple string detonations at once.
		
		>>>letter = 'z'
		>>>letter * 10
		'zzzzzzzzzz'
		
		Also,
		
		>>>2 + 3
		5
		
		>>>'2' + '3'
		23                 # con of dynamic typing; if usere enters strins you may get 23 instead of 5
		
		
		
Objects in python usually have bulitin methods and these methods themselves are essentially functions that are inside the object. 
We can also create our own functions in our own methods.		
		 
		>>>x = 'Hello World'
		>>>x
		'Hello World'
		>>>x.upper
		<function str.upper>
		>>>x.upper()
		'HELLO WORLD'
		>>>x
		'Hello World'
		>>>x.lower()
		'hello world'
		
		>>>x.split()
		['Hello','World']
		
		>>>x = 'Hi this is a string'
		>>>x.split()
		['Hi','this','is','a','string']
		>>>x.split(i)
		['H', ' th', 's ', 's a str', 'ng']
		
		Strings are not mutable!
		(you can't use indexing to change individual elements of a string)
		
		You can use hashtag# to create comments in our code
