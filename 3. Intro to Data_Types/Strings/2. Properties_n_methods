STRING PROPERTIES AND METHODS

	IMMUTABILITY: It means we can't change any part of data once declared.
	
	eg:- >>>name = 'Sam'
	     >>>name[0] = 'P'
		 ----------Tracebackerror-------------
		 
		 >>>name[1:] = 'am'
		 >>>last_letters = name[1:]
		 >>>last_letters
		 'am'
		 >>>'P' + last_letters           # STRING CONCATENATION
		 'Pam'
		 
STRING CONCATENATION: It allows us to quickly put strings together.
		
		>>>x = 'Hello World '
		>>>x + "it is beautiful outside!!!"
		'Hello World it is beautiful outside!!!'
		
		
There is also STRING MULTIPLICATION you can do-----to do multiple string detonations at once.
		
		>>>letter = 'z'
		>>>letter * 10
		'zzzzzzzzzz'
		
		Also,
		
		>>>2 + 3
		5
		
		>>>'2' + '3'
		23                 # con of dynamic typing; if usere enters strins you may get 23 instead of 5
		
		
		
Objects in python usually have bulitin methods and these methods themselves are essentially functions that are inside the object. 
We can also create our own functions in our own methods.
