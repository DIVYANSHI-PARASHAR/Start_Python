STRINGS
(sequence of characters)

Strings are ordered sequences, it means we can use indexing and slicing to grab sub-sections of the string.
Therefore we know each character has a specific position to be in.

INDEXING notation uses [] notation after the string(or variable assigned to tha string)
Indexing allows you to grab a single character from the string.

These actions us [] brackets and a number index to indicate positions of what you wish to grab.

       Character: h  e  l  l  o
       Index    : 0  1  2  3  4
   Reverse Index: 0 -4 -3 -2 -1
   
   Why Reverse Index? : So maybe you wanted to grab the last letter of a string but you didn't actually know how long the string was.

SLICING allows you to grab a subsection of multiple characters, a 'slice' of the string.
