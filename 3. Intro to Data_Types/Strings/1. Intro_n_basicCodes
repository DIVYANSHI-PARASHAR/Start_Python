STRINGS                                      {FOR BASIC CODES, SCROLL DOWN}
(sequence of characters)

Strings are ordered sequences, it means we can use indexing and slicing to grab sub-sections of the string.
Therefore we know each character has a specific position to be in.

INDEXING notation uses [] notation after the string(or variable assigned to tha string)
Indexing allows you to grab a single character from the string.

These actions us [] brackets and a number index to indicate positions of what you wish to grab.

       Character: h  e  l  l  o
       Index    : 0  1  2  3  4
   Reverse Index: 0 -4 -3 -2 -1
   
   Why Reverse Index? : So maybe you wanted to grab the last letter of a string but you didn't actually know how long the string was.

SLICING allows you to grab a subsection of multiple characters, a 'slice' of the string.
       Syntax: [start: stop: step]
       
       start implies to numerical index for the slice start.
       stop implies you to the index you will go up to (BUT NOT INCLUDE).
       step implies to the size of jump you take.

EXAMPLES:

>>>len('hello')
5
>>>len('I am')
4

>>>mystring = 'Hello World'
>>>mystring
'Hello World'
>>>mystring[0]
'H'
>>>mystring[8]
'r'
>>>mystring[-2]
'l'
>>>mystring[-3]
'r'
>>>mystring[-1]
'd'

>>>mystring = 'abcdefghijk'
>>>mystring
'abcdefghijk'
>>>mystring[2]
'c'
>>>mystring[2:]
'cdefghijk'
>>>mystring[:3]
'abc'
>>>mystring[3:6]
'def'
>>>mystring[1:3]
'bc'

>>>mystring
'abcdefghijk'
>>>mystring[::]
'abcdefghijk'

>>>mystring[::2]
'acegik'
>>>mystring[::3]
'adgj'

>>>mystring[2:7:2]
'ceg'

>>>mystring[::-1]        #REVERSE A STRING!!!
'kjihgfedcba'
