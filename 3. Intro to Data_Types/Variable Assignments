# RULES FOR VARIABLE NAMES
  
    1. Names can not start with a number.
    2. There can be no spaces in the name, use underscore(_) instead.
    3. Can't use any of these symbols: + : ' ' , < > / ? | \ ( ) ! @ # $ % ^ * * ~ - 
    4. It's considered best practice that names are lowercase. (leave option of UPPERCASE for global variables
    5. Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like 'list; and 'str'.
    
    
# PYTHON FOR DYNAMIC TYPING
    1. This means you can reassign variable to different data types.
    
    This makes Python very flexible in assigning data types, thus is different than other languages that are 'statically-typed'.
    
    # PROS OF DYNAMIC TYPING:
        -very easy to work with
        -faster development time
    # CONS OF DYNAMIC TYPING:
        -may result in bugs for unexpected data types
        -you need to be aware of type()
        TYPE FUNCTION:  type() tells the data type.
        >>>type(1)
        int
        >>>type(2.3)
        float
        >>>type('Apple')
        str
        
        
    TIP: if by mistake you use a s[ecial keyword for variable assignment, then Restart the Kernel and run all cells again.
    On restarting the Kernel, all variables are lost. That's why you have to run the cells again.
    [Kernel--> Restart and clear all outputs.]
