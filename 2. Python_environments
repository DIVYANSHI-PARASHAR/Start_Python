   Notebooks use blocks of code that are referred to as cells
   In notebooks, you can split up your code into cells and run all those in one single notebook.
   You can see multiple inputs and multiple outputs in one single window
   
   Output is shown directly below the cell, therefore you can easily fix mistakes!

   PLUS, .ipynb files do not open on clicking, you can only open them through jupyter noteook system.
